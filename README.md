A little showcase for some stuff that I have made during my studies so far. These are in order according to the folders.
<h3>Application for public transportation</h3>

It is meant for the public transport drivers and it includes an speedometer, timed detection when movement comes to a halt, a query which asks for a reason for the stop
and saved logging for those stops to review for later. It also can detect your location and show it in Google Maps with a marker. In addition the user can keep track of the amount passangers by adding/reducing with the + - buttons.
