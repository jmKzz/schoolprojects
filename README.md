A little showcase for some stuff that I have made during my studies so far. These are in order according to the folders.
<h3>Application for public transportation</h3>

It is meant for the public transport drivers and it includes an speedometer, timed detection when movement comes to a halt, a query which asks for a reason for the stop
and saved logging for those stops to review for later. It also can detect your location and show it in Google Maps with a marker. In addition the user can keep track of the amount passangers by adding/reducing with the + - buttons. 

<h3>Jigsaw puzzle for tablet</h3>

This was made during the summer for a customer. It was made with Unity C# and it's meant to use with a tablet. More specifically it was made with Apple products in mind (iPad) and required an MAC for building it. 

<h3>Paint software</h3>

I used Visual Studio to make this one and it has several essential features made for it. For example you can save or print your creations. Redo and Undo functions also work to an extent. Painting itself has no issues and you can also create shapes like circles or rectangles by creating an instance, in other words spawn them.
