# School projects
A little showcase for some stuff that I have made during my studies so far. These are in order according to the folders.
<h3>Application for public transportation</h3>

It is meant for the public transport drivers and it includes an speedometer, timed detection when movement comes to a halt, a query which asks for a reason for the occured stop
and viewable log information for the stops. It can also detect your location and show it in Google Maps with a marker. In addition the user can keep track of the amount passangers by adding/reducing with the + - buttons. All the necessary generated information are also stored into memory. 

<h3>Jigsaw puzzle for tablet</h3>

This was made during the summer for a customer. It was made with Unity C# and it's meant to use with a tablet. More specifically it was made with Apple products in mind (iPad) and required an MacBook to build it. 

<h3>Paint software</h3>

I used Visual Studio to make this one and it has several essential features made for it. For example you can save or print your creations. Redo and Undo functions also work to an extent and the software has some localization with the menus. Painting itself has no issues and you can also create shapes like circles or rectangles by creating an instance, in other words spawn them. The picture is also work of Picasso if you can't tell :D.

<h3>To-do list</h3>

Just a basic to-do list that I did using javascript, html and css. I made it so that it works for mobile as well. Nothing more to it.

<h3>Threejs stuff</h3>

Just some fun visualization with imported models and a self made house by using threejs geometry system. The car and the door are interactable with some keypresses. This runs in a browser and Firefox is preferred.

<h3>Voting System</h3>

Me and a fellow student created this voting system together using django, html, CSS and AJAX. You can create your own query's and share them with others. It also has a piechart that shows how the votes were distributed. I was mainly responsible for the look of the app and I managed to make it look decent enough for mobile users aswell.
